This ACGAN (Auxiliary Classifier GAN) code implements a GAN where the generator creates class-conditioned images,
and the discriminator not only classifies images as real or fake but also predicts their class labels

The provided code for WGAN implements Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), a generative adversarial network variant that
uses the Wasserstein distance (or Earth-Mover distance) as its metric to improve training stability and address 
issues like mode collapse in standard GANs
